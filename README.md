Note to self, 2 branches
main produces a depth 3 graph. There will be some imperfections, probably a bug or two.
WIP is some work I got part way through and no longer recall. It has to do with increasing the depth to 4 but may or may not all be consequences of that.
Increasing the depth to 4 is the point where the combinatorial explosion gets _really_ bad.
